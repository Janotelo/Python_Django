                            <p>There's nothing like the views you get when 
                                hiking in the mountains! And I wasn't even 
                                prepared for what happened whilst I was 
                                enjoying the view!

        <h2>What I Do</h2>
        <p>
            I love programming, I love to help others and I enjoy exploring 
            new technologies in general!
        </p>
        <p>
            My goal is to keep on growing as a developer - and if I could help
            you do the same, I'd be very happy!
        </p>
